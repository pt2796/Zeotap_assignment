## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an eCommerce dataset to extract business insights, build a lookalike model for customer recommendations, and perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The dataset includes customer information, product details, and transaction history.

### Objectives
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.
2. Build a Lookalike Model to recommend similar customers.
3. Segment customers into clusters using K-Means clustering.
